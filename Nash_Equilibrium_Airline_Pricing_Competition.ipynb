        "\n",
        "* If AirFly lowers their economy class price, they'll attract more customers but their profit margin will decrease, making it less profitable.\n",
        "* If AirFly raises their price, they'll lose customers to SkyHigh, leading to lower profits.\n",
        "* The same logic applies to SkyHigh.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Points:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Stable Pricing:** Both airlines have found a stable price point where they are maximizing their profits given the competitor's pricing.\n",
        "* **Competitive Advantage:** Neither airline has a significant competitive advantage over the other in this scenario.\n",
        "* **Simplified Model:**  Remember that this result is based on a simplified model. In reality,  airline pricing involves many other factors.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Further Analysis:**\n",
        "\n",
        "This result could be further investigated by:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Testing different demand functions:**  Exploring more complex demand models to see how it affects the outcome.\n",
        "* **Adding more airlines:**  Simulating a scenario with multiple competitors to analyze how the Nash Equilibrium changes.\n",
        "* **Introducing other factors:**  Including real-world factors like seasonality, fuel costs, and customer preferences.\n",
